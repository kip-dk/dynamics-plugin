INSTALLATION
------------
The software is installed using nuget installation process.

After installation you need to setup your local environment. This is done by renaming template files (simply remove the .template from the filename) and then
adjust the content of the file to your need.

The following template files need to be adjusted:

deploy.cmd.template  (a command line tool that can deploy your plugin assembly to Dynamics 365 CE)
Entities/filter.xml.template (an xml file describing the entities you need to work with in your plugin)
Entities/generate.cmd.template (a command line tool that can generate early bound entities according to filter.xml spec)
bin/coretools/Kipon.Xrm.Cmd.exe.config.template (configuration file for the Kipon.Xrm.Cmd.exe tool, you can added you CRM connection string here if you would like to avoid putting it directly into the generate.cmd command line script)

Finally you must include the Kipon/Kipon.Xrm.cs source in you C# dynamics-plugin-assembly-library project. This file is an accumulated single source version of all the coded needed to build
plugins, extending from the Kipon.Xrm.BasePlugin.


UPGRADE
-------
After upgrade, remember to regenerate entities, using the generate.cmd tool in the Entities folder. This will ensure that your entity model is consistant with the expectations of the Kipon.Xrm.BasePlugin.

In rare cases, you can get compile errors after upgrade to a newer version of the framework. 

This will happen in situations where basic interfaces/methods in the model has been added, and implementations is generated by the generate tool. Just
regenerate your entities and the compile errors will go away.
